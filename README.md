# Analysis of SARS-CoV-2

## Things learned:
* Translations seen on pub med are using the letter corresponding to the amino acids. For example, Ala -> A; Leu -> L.
* transcription process is pretty much dna -> rna -> polypeptide chain[^2]
* dna codon to amino acid found at on wikipedia[^3]
  - **Q:** wikipedia has table for DNA codon to amino acid, is this supposed to be RNA?
  - **A:** probably. right below we can see that: "The DNA codon table is essentially identical to that for RNA, but with U replaced by T."
* there are 3 reading frames [^4]
* It seems it seems to be the case that for Wu et al, all proteins start with an M(start codon). meaning that anything between STOP and START is garbage
